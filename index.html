      <p>
        A forest is a big area where there are lots of trees growing close together. It's like a big community of trees that
        work together to create a special environment for animals and plants to live in. Forests are important because they
        provide us with clean air, water, and shelter for many different creatures. They also help to keep the earth's climate
        stable by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So it's really important that we take care of our forests!

      <h2 class="subtitle">Type of forest with high rainfall</h2>
        <p>
          It's called a rainforest because it rains almost every day.
          These forests are home to many different kinds of plants and animals, like monkeys, birds, and snakes. Rainforests are
          really important for our planet because they help produce oxygen and keep the air clean. Unfortunately, many rainforests
          around the world are being destroyed by people cutting down trees or burning them for farming or building. It's
          important that we try to protect these special places so that they can continue to provide homes for animals and plants,
          as well as benefits for humans too!

      <h2 class="subtitle">Area of land where little precipitation occurs</h2>
      <p>A desert is a place where there is very little rain or other forms of precipitation. It's usually very hot and dry, with
      lots of sand and rocks. Plants and animals that live in the desert have adapted to survive in these harsh conditions,
      such as by storing water or having thick fur to protect against the sun. Some deserts are found near the equator, while
      others are located in more temperate regions. Despite their challenging environment, deserts can be beautiful and
      fascinating places to explore!

      <h2 class="subtitle">Large permanent human settlement</h2>
      <p>
        A city is a large and permanent human settlement where many people live, work, and play. It is usually much bigger than
        a town or village. Cities have tall buildings, busy streets, and lots of different places to visit like parks, museums,
        and shops. Cities are also known for their transportation systems like buses, trains, and subways that help people get around
        easily. They have modern infrastructure such as roads, bridges, electricity grids, water supply networks that make life
        convenient.
